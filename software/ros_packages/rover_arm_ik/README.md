# Rover Arm IK Packages Overview

This document provides a brief overview of the main software packages responsible for autonomous operation of the arm. This document aims to inform members about the structure an purpose of each package, as well as how to launch different files for simulation and control. Two main libraries allow us the functionality to preform autonomous operations with the arm: ROS_Control and Moveit!. Moveit! provides us with a number of different plugins and packages for simulating motion, motion planning, and improved kinematics on our arm. ROS_Control provides us with the framework to connect the planned motions from Moveit! libraries with the actual hardware of the arm. In the sections below, a more in depth overview of how these two libraries function is presented.
